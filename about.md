My name is Tyler Schmidt. I'm a System Programmer living in the Bay Area who makes utility applications on the side. Currently, I'm pursuing a Master's degree from the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) specializing in [Computing Systems](https://omscs.gatech.edu/specialization-computing-systems).

I am the Lead Software Architect of the [Leviathan Logic Engine](https://github.com/Exonoesis/Leviathan-Logic-Engine), a game-creation framework. My contributions involve keeping a modular framework and using automated testing to maintain stability.

In the past, I worked at [Moebius Solutions](https://www.moesol.com/) for about a year after graduating from the [University of California Santa Cruz](https://www.ucsc.edu/). There, I contributed developer documentation that was used as a reference for on-boarding and improved the responsiveness of two web applications up to 80%.
